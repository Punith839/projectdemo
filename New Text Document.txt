I am a complete beginner and I want to learn JavaScript Fundamentals for Web Interactivity (Module 6) in a very simple, step-by-step, beginner-friendly way. Please explain everything like I know nothing.

Give me:

1. What this module is about (in simple words).
2. Tools required (which editor/browser to use, where to download, and why).
3. Where to go and what to do at each step (like create index.html, create script.js, how to run in browser, how to check console, etc.).
4. Every topic explained with examples:

   * What is JavaScript?
   * How to link JavaScript to HTML (inline, internal, external).
   * Variables (with 2–3 examples).
   * Functions (with 2–3 examples).
   * Conditions (if/else, switch – with 2–3 examples).
   * Loops (for, while – with 2–3 examples).
   * Events (click, hover – with 2–3 examples).
   * DOM Manipulation (changing text, style, hiding/showing elements – with 2–3 examples).
5. Practice tasks for each concept (so I can try myself).
6. A final mini project that combines all these concepts into one simple interactive webpage (like greeting a user, changing background, printing numbers, showing/hiding content).
7. Very beginner-friendly instructions: mention where to type code, where to save, how to open in browser, and how to test it.
